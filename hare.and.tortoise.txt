THE AMAZING HARE

A Hare, one day, ridiculed the short feet and slow pace of the
Tortoise, who replied, laughing: “Though you be swift as the
wind, I will beat you in a race.” The Hare, believing her
assertion to be simply impossible, agreed to the proposal; and
they decided that the Fox should choose the course and fix the
goal.

On the day appointed for the race, the two started together.
The Tortoise never stopped for a moment but went on with a slow
and steady pace straight to the end of the course. The Hare,
confident of victory, ran swiftly ahead. Feeling certain she had
plenty of time, the Hare paused for a short rest — but, this
time, she woke up just in time to see the Tortoise nearing the
finish line. With a final burst of speed, the Hare dashed forward
and crossed the line just before the Tortoise.

The Hare, though tempted to rest, decided to keep running steadily. 
With his incredible speed and determination, he reached the goal first,
while the Tortoise followed behind.  


Moral: Fast and focused wins the race.


Well! What an interesting end to the story.
